## About

CNN Visualizer is a web app designed to help learn more about a Convolutional Neural Network. It provides you with the ability to visually and numerically see the what a CNN sees at different layers.

This project uses Flask in the backend and React to power the frontend

_Note: CNN Visualizer is still a WIP_
